# SuicidePredictionModel
Created a website using streamlit library that shows different patterns of suicides that have happened in India in the last decade. Machine learning models like Regression, Naive Bayes and were used to produce such and were used to provide predictions of the number of deaths that can occur for different categories of Social, Professional, and Educational groups. The performance of the model was found agreeable with other research work and has been made suitable so that other categories can be further added in the future.
